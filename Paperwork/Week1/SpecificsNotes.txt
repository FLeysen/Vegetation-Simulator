Focus on actual growth progression and spreading, not extreme scientific accuracy (i.e. where leaves appear, branches etc.)
Meant to be usable in a game (keep performance in mind)
Environmental factors determine everything: nutrients and water in ground, temperatures, light and airflow (for spreading)
Environment changes over time based on current plant activity (many plants with little rain => plants start dying)
Several different plants (don't have to be predefined, can be based on factors like "amount of water needed per day", or "minimal survival temperature"...)
Should be as dynamic as possible: let's say I want to add a river => existing plant life will start responding to that, new plant life might grow
