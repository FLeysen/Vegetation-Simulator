Move some specifics to outline
Specify how new plants are created (via framework)
Allowing users to start from non-empty might not be a good idea
Rules where to go, how to evolve
Specify which parameters and how many for prototype object
Perhaps not all types can be compiled into a single object
Example: vines are highly complex (need a nearby tree to grow)
Define scale: big
The bigger the more diverse everything has to be
Make visualization of where to go
Factors given without research (i.e.: which factors needed to grow)
Scope too big, aim more to specific biotope
How long would the simulation take (5 years vs 100 years?)
Research question may be split into subresearch
Meet 13:00 thursday
