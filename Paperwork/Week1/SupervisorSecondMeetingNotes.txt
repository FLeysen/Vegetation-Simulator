Allowed to use existing assets (for visualization)
Representing different seasons within vegetation (texture/model/shader)
Representing different stages of progression (might not work like this)
Perhaps do keep soil within scope? Might lead to interesting results
Ones that grow on other vegetation are highly complex, can be perhaps stretch goal
Specific growth locations not needed before doing research
Wind energy plant can be good to show off possibilities of framework
Process segment also temporary
Method and approach: add model of how to interpret
